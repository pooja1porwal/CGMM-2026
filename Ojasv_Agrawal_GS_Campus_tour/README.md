# SGSITS Virtual Campus

The visitor flow is source-to-destination navigation. Administrators manage stops and directed journeys, draw route geometry, upload ordered checkpoint photos, and edit or delete either record. Add `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to the frontend environment and latitude/longitude to each stop to enable Google Maps walking directions; without it, the responsive campus plan and admin-drawn route are used.

An interactive campus-tour and computer-graphics project for Shri G. S. Institute of Technology & Science, Indore. Visitors can choose a place from the campus image map or sliding directory, follow an animated route, and explore its panorama and information. Only the college administrator has an account and can publish tour stops.

## Features

- Public spectator experience with no registration or login
- Single role-protected college administrator login
- Admin clicks the campus image to store responsive normalized X/Y coordinates
- Admin uploads a description, history, audio script, 360° panorama, and gallery photos
- Clickable numbered campus markers and searchable slide-out place directory
- Interactive drag/zoom panorama, browser narration, gallery, and visitor information
- Canvas DDA route rasterization from the Main Gate
- Quadratic Bezier route animation and 2D translate/rotate transforms
- SGSITS navy/gold visual system, logo, identity lockup, and responsive layout

## Stack

- React 19 + Vite
- HTML Canvas + `requestAnimationFrame`
- Node.js + Express
- Prisma ORM + SQLite
- JWT + bcrypt

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
npm run db:generate
npm run db:init
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The API health endpoint is `http://localhost:4000/api/health`.

### Demo administrator

```text
Email: admin@sgsits.ac.in
Password: admin123
```

Change these local demo credentials and `JWT_SECRET` before deployment.

## Render deployment

The project uses separate database schemas:

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — default Render/PostgreSQL deployment schema
- `prisma/schema.sqlite.prisma` — local SQLite development schema
- `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma` — explicit PostgreSQL schema used by `render.yaml`

The default schema is PostgreSQL, so both Render's dashboard-default Prisma
commands and the included `render.yaml` work. The blueprint explicitly creates
the tables and idempotently seeds the administrator and initial campus stops. Set
`DATABASE_URL` to the PostgreSQL connection string supplied by Render, not a
`file:` URL. Also set `CLIENT_URL` to the deployed frontend origin. A trailing
slash is accepted and normalized. Multiple origins can be supplied as a
comma-separated list when Vercel preview deployments also need API access.

For an existing Render service whose root directory is the repository root, use:

```text
Build Command: npm run render:build
Start Command: npm start
```

If its Root Directory is already `apps/backend`, the `render.yaml` build command
works directly from that directory.

## Computer graphics viva summary

The campus map is a raster image used as a normalized 2D coordinate space. When the administrator clicks it, the application stores percentages rather than fixed screen pixels, so markers remain aligned across viewport sizes. Canvas uses the DDA algorithm to plot route pixels from the Main Gate to a selected stop. An animated direction marker follows a quadratic Bezier curve, with translation and rotation applied every frame. The panorama adds an interactive image-space transformation through drag and zoom.
